Software Architecture Design Patterns in Jakarta EE, published by Packt

## About the Video Course
Java Enterprise developers often come across the similar problems independent of vertical domains. This leads us to find a solution for the same problem every time, and we often "reinvent the wheel". Wouldn't it be great to have a set of such common problems and proven solutions? 
Beginning with the most common Gang of Four patterns including the Structural patterns, behavioral patterns, creational patterns and progressing to newer patterns such as MVC, Registry or Service Mesh in Jakarta EE, you will learn their Enterprise Java implementations.  Evolving from traditional Java EE environments to a "Cloud Native" and Microservice architecture. 
After explaining the patterns, each video will demonstrate practical examples of how to use them with Java and Java EE/Jakarta EE. By the end of the course you'll have proven solutions from experienced hands for recurring design problems.
